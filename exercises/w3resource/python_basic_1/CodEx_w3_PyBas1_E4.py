# Exercise 4:

# Problem Statement:

# Write a Python program that calculates the area of a circle based on the radius entered by the user.


# Solution Attempt:

# Import the pi constant from the math module
from math import pi

# Prompt the user to input the radius
radius = float(input("Input the radius of the circle: "))

# Calculate the area of the circle
area = pi * radius ** 2

# Print the area
print("The area of a circle with radius ",str(radius)," is ",area,".")


# Lessons Learned:

# Syntax:
# input(): Built-in function used to get user input from the console
# str(): Converts an object to a string
